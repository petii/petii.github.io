      Joined the freshly formed Budapest team. Immediately found myself as a 
      web developer helping to push a project across the finish line. Then
      the team took ownership of an abandoned part of the product, where the
      experience of working with legacy systems became helpful. Slowly
      transitioned away from front-end to work on topics related to runtime
      data persistence.

      Working on OpenScape Xpert Client (mission critical telco solution).
      Started as an intern while finishing up university then joined full-time.
      Provided plenty of opportunities to grow both as a developer and as a 
      person working in IT. <br />
      As a developer deepening my knowledge of C++14, getting experience
      with legacy codebases, distributed solutions, CI pipelines, automated 
      testing, linux development. <br />
      As a person, got to see the importance of clear communication, effective
      planning and more of multi-national company culture.

      Joined a team of 3 other interns on a new project that set out to automate
      the company's internal processes. With no technical leadership and 
      arbitrary restrictions due to the intern status, it was a bit chaotic and
      hacky at times but we managed to prove the value of the project and got 
      internal funding.

      After cutting facebook usage out of my life for the most part I realized
      missing out on a number of events. The idea of a light mobile app that can
      browse events and synchronize them into the calendar came up but unfortunately
      before finishing the project the Graph API changed and did not return event
      data anymore.

      When lockdown hit we found ourselves struggling a bit with retrospective
      meetings. As a learning project before jumping onto extending our internal
      test report server I explored web development which to my surprise has
      come a long way in the 10+ years I haven't looked at it.
    tech: [C#, ASP.Net Core, TypeScript, Angular]

      Used it as the tool to teach myself some basic concepts like OOP during
      highschool which lasted well into university studies. When I learnt about
      "modern C++" I had a newfound fascination with the language and compile
      time validation in general.
      Stopped keeping up with the newer standards which is quite unfortunate
      as constraints and concepts seem like a great addition to templating
      and it would be nice to experience modules after years and years of
      writing ifndefs.
